## Places to Visit Blog

This is just my personal blog to keep track of places I would like to visit one day.
It features an admin panel that is exclusive to myself and data retrieval from Wikipedia.

If you'd like to clone it for yourself:
```
git clone https://github.com/cabbagebeard/places-to-visit.git 
cd places-to-visit
bundle install
sudo service postgresql start
rake db:migrate
rails s
```
